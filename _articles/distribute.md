There are several ways that you can distribute your data:

 * As a website.  This provides the most flexibility and the potential for a powerful user interface, at the cost of increased complexity.  See the [index](/) for inspiration.
 * Within a computer algebra system such as [Sage](https://sagemath.org), [Magma](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/), or [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/).  This can provide very useful integrations with other parts of that system, but makes your data less accessible to a broader audience.
 * As an appendix to a research paper.  This option can make the context of the data more clear and can be appropriate for narrowly focused data sets, but generally forgoes the more advanced user interfaces of the previous options.
 * Within an [existing database](/).  If your data fits within the scope of an existing project, contributing to that project rather than starting your own project can save a lot of work.
 * As plain text files available for download.  This is the easiest option, but does not offer the user the ability to search or easily interact with the data.  For large data sets it also requires users to download large files even if they're interested in only a small part.
