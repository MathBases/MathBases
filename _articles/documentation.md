In order for your data to be useful, users need to know what it means.  At a minimum, you should provide documentation about the [schema](/a/schema) for any files that users can download, or that are presented directly on a website.  Additional useful documentation can include:

* Explanations and references for the underlying mathematics so that users have the context for understanding your data.

* Tutorials for how to use the site if there are any advanced features

* A mechanism for contacting the database's authors (commonly an email address, google group or form)

* A description of how to cite your database in an academic publication.  Eventually, you may want to also list the publications that cite your database.

* Acknowledments of organizations and grants that have supported the development of the database.

* Links to the source code that serves the website and source code used to compute the data.
