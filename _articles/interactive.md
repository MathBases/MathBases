Webpages are not just static collections of text and images.  There are various ways that interactive aspects can improve your site.  In addition to search inputs, here are some examples from databases in the [index](/):

1. [House of graphs](https://houseofgraphs.org/) provides the ability to specify a graph by [drawing it](https://houseofgraphs.org/draw_graph) on a canvas.

2. The [LMFDB](https://lmfdb.org) has [knowls](https://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/doc.knowl) which expand within the page to provide definitions and context without cluttering the flow of the text.

The basic tool for building interactive features in a website is [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), which allows for code to be executed in the user's browers.  See the discussion of [frontend tools](/a/frontend) for more details.
