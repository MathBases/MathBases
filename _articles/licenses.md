It is important to include a license with your data and code so that others know how they are legally allowed to use it.  We recommend open source licenses as a way to maximize the ability for your code and data to be used.  If you are using Github to host your code or data, see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/licensing-a-repository) for how to add a license.

# Code licenses

Open source licenses for code fall into two categories: copyleft licenses, which require derivative works to use the same license, and permissive licenses, which do not require derivative works to remain closed source.  The main copyleft license is the [GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), while there is a broader range of commonly used permissive licenses, such as [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit), [BSD](https://opensource.org/license/bsd-3-clause), and [Apache](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0).

# Data licenses

When distributing data, you should make clear how it can be used.  The most common family of data licenses are by Creative Commons ranging from the most permissive, [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) to [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) which requires attribution, to [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en) which requires derivatives be shared, to [CC-BY-SA-NC](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) which prohibits commercial use.
