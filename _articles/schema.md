A schema is a document that describes the column names and types used in each table of your database.  If you are using a relational database, creating a schema is a key step in defining how your data fits together, and even if you are storing your data in another way a schema can be a valuable way to organize your computation.

As an example, you can find schemas for all of the tables in the LMFDB [here](https://www.lmfdb.org/api/): click on any collection name, like [gps_conj_classes](https://www.lmfdb.org/api/gps_conj_classes/) and then on "Show schema."
