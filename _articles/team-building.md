Working in a group offers several advantages: other people can provide feedback and contribute expertise and labor.  This can be especially valuable if you are missing required knowledge or skills, from mathematical background to programming experience to web development.

[Conferences](/conferences) and the [Zulip chat server](https://code4math.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/416464-MathBases) can be places to look for people interested in your project, as well as other mathematical environments within your field.  As you gather people, including them in important decisions and work can help incentivize them to contribute to the project.  Make sure that you design systems that give people credit for their contributions.
