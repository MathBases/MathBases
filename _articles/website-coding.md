title: Creating a website or user interface
author: stub

Having decided on a method for [distributing](/a/distribute) your data and having started the process of [computing](/a/math-coding) it, you need to create the interface by which a user interacts with your data.

Regardless of the interface, you should provide the following

 * a [detailed description](/a/schema) of the data format
 * a [license](/a/licenses) and appropriate metadata
 * instructions on how to cite your data
 * objects in your data should have unique identifiers
 * references to the algorithms and implementation used to compute the data
 * a description of whether the data is complete for some range of parameters
 * a description of what [testing](/a/math-testing) you have done to ensure the data's reliability
 * a mechanism to contact the author of the data (e.g. by email or a form)

If you are creating a web interface, you may want to

 * make the site accessible by both newcomers and experts by including ways to browse, to search for exampes of phenomena, and to look up a specific object.
 * include explanatory context of the underlying mathematics (the LMFDB uses [knowls](https://www.lmfdb.org/knowledge/show/doc.knowl) for this purpose)
 * provide lists of interesting objects among the larger collection, and ways to view a random object.
 * provide visualizations of the objects if possible
 * provide a mechanism for feedback if users find issues or have suggestions
 * provide a changelog or list of recent updates
 * provide a way for registered users to upload data or references (if appropriate for your dataset)
 * eventually, include a list of publications citing your resource
 * include [documentation and tutorials](/a/documentation)
