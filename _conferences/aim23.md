This workshop will be devoted to building capacity for open-source software supporting mathematics research. In the spirit of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy's declaration of 2023 as the "Year of Open Science", workshop participants will gather to share their knowledge on open-source solutions such as the LMFDB database of examples from number theory, the PreTeXt XML language for authoring scholarly documents, the SageMath mathematics software system, and more. Discussions will also center on the cyberinfrastrastructure mathematicians use to collaborate on such products, as well as mathematical research itself, including such services as GitHub, arXiv, MathOverflow, and Twitter/Mastodon. The main goal of the workshop is to scope the future of how mathematics will be done in the 21st century, and ensure an inclusive environment for all mathematicians to use these tools as well as contribute to their maintenance.

The main topics for the workshop are:

 * Open-source software products used for mathematical databases, communications, and computation.
 * Cyberinfrastructure for 21st century mathematical collaborations.
 * Human infrastructure for maintaining open-source ecosystems around these products and services.
 * Broadening participation in this infrastructure by underrepresented mathematical communities.
