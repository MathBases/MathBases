Digital and computational solutions are becoming the prevalent means for the generation, communication, processing, storage and curation of mathematical information. Separate communities have developed to investigate and build computer based systems for computer algebra, automated deduction, and mathematical publishing as well as novel user interfaces. While all of these systems excel in their own right, their integration can lead to synergies offering significant added value. The Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM) offers a venue for discussing and developing solutions to the great challenges posed by the integration of these diverse areas.

The conference addresses research from the following areas, and it usually adds workshops and a doctoral pogramme:

 * Calculemus
 * Mathematical Knowledge Management (MKM)
 * Digital Mathematical Libraries (DML)
