 Modern mathematical software and large datasets of mathematical knowledge allow new approaches to solving mathematical problems, and support new kinds of mathematical exploration. In the past, lack of cooperation led to each project developing its own standards and techniques. Both developers and users experienced the resulting incompatibilities and fragmentation as serious usability issues and major obstacle to wider adoption, and none of the projects can address these successfully on their own. To make further progress that will eventually result in truly comprehensive and advanced computer mathematical assistant systems, the developers of individual software projects must start working together and tackle questions of interoperability, software engineering, and knowledge management on a large scale.

Concretely, this Dagstuhl Seminar brought together system developers, library authors, and users from three key areas of computer-supported mathematics: theorem provers, symbolic computation, and databases of mathematical structures. All three areas develop large formal mathematical libraries, but they do so in fundamentally different and incompatible ways. Theorem provers optimize for precise definitions and automation of proof support, often employing complex and abstract representation languages that capture exactly the semantics of the mathematical concepts of interest. Computer algebra systems, on the other hand, prioritize the efficiency of computation, which usually requires hardware-near representations that can be optimized for speed. Mathematical datasets finally employ general purpose database languages, which are optimized for indexing and fast querying, often requiring non-trivial encodings of mathematical objects in terms of concrete data. Over several decades of mostly independent development, these different communities have built software systems that are as impressively large as they are different from each other.
