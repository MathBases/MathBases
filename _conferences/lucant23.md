This will be a one-week conference broadly focused on the topics of the [LMFDB](https://lmfdb.org), mathematical databases, computation, number theory, and arithmetic geometry. The conference will include invited talks, presentations by authors of papers submitted to the conference and selected by the scientific committee following peer-review, as well as time for research and collaboration. We plan to publish a proceedings volume that will include all of the accepted papers.
