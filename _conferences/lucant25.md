This will be a one-week conference broadly focused on the topics of the [LMFDB](https://lmfdb.org), mathematical databases, computation, and number theory. The conference will include invited talks, presentations by authors of papers submitted to the conference and selected by the scientific committee following peer-review, as well as time for research and collaboration. We plan to publish a proceedings volume that will include all of the accepted papers.
