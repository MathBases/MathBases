Initiated in 1997, at the Materials Laboratory of the University of the Basque Country, Spain, the Bilbao Crystallographic Server has since been offering its crystallographic and solid state programs and utilities, free of charge.

Due to the variety of the topics related, the programs hosted on the server are grouped into the so called shells which are:

* Space Groups Retrieval Tools
  * GENPOS, WYCKPOS, HKLCOND, MAXSUB, SERIES, WYCKSETS, NORMALIZER, KVEC, SYMMETRY OPERATIONS, IDENTIFY GROUP
* Magnetic Space Groups
  * MGENPOS, MWYCKPOS, MNORMALIZER, IDENTIFY MAGNETIC GROUP, BNS2OG, mCIF2PCR, MPOINT, MAGNEXT, MAXMAGN, MAGMODELIZE, STRCONVERT, k-SUBGROUPSMAG, MAGNDATA, MVISUALIZE, MTENSOR, MAGNETIC REP, Get_mirreps
* Group - Subgroup Relations of Space Groups
  * SUBGROUPGRAPH, HERMANN, COSETS, WYCKSPLIT, MINSUP, SUPERGROUPS, CELLSUB, CELLSUPER, NONCHAR, COMMONSUBS, COMMONSUPER, INDEX, SUBGROUPS
