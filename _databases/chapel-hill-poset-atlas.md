 * m=9: Connected hook length posets and indecomposable disconnected hook length posets.
 * m=9: Connected d-complete and connected jeu de taquin posets.
 * m=7: Naturally labeled posets and hook length posets.

The following data is listed for posets with up to 7 elements: inverse order extensions, isomorphisms from natural labellings to standard forms, and name lookups for standard forms.
