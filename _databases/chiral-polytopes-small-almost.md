title: An Atlas of Chiral Polytopes for Small Almost Simple Groups

---

This Atlas contains all chiral polytopes whose automorphism group is an almost simple group G such that S <= G <= Aut(S) and S is a simple group of order less than 1 million appearing in the Atlas of Finite Groups by Conway et al.
