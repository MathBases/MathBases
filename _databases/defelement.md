This database contains the definition of various finite elements (e.g. Lagrange, Hermite, Taylor-Hood) used for the numerical solution of partial differential equations with the finite element method. Each entry contains various informations: the number of degrees of freedom, reference elements, continuity, De Rham complexes, and more.
