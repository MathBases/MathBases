This collaborative project is

 * a database of combinatorial statistics and maps on combinatorial collections and
 * a search engine, identifying your data as the composition of known maps and statistics.
   * a combinatorial collection is a collection of finite sets (e.g. the set of permutations)
   * a combinatorial map is a map between collections (e.g. the inverse of a permutation)
   * a combinatorial statistic (or parameter) is a map from a collection to the integers (e.g. the order of a permutation)

The database provides a tool for recognizing user-provided combinatorial statistics as compositions of known maps and statistics.
