A game to find putatively optimal packings in complex projective space with the goal of proving optimality of as many packings as possible.

This repository concerns the problem of packing n lines, represented by unit vectors, through the origin of C^d such that the angles between the lines are as large as possible. The problem has applications in fields such as compressed sensing, digital fingerprinting, quantum state tomography, and multiple description coding.
