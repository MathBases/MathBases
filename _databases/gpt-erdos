This database documents candidate solutions for Erdős problems produced via LLM-driven proof search and autoformalization.

Here are some examples of the objects within:

- **Problem 281**: A problem with a potentially new proof generated by the system.
- **Problem 591**: A problem where an exact solution in the literature was identified.
- **Problem 78**: A problem solved as stated, but with hidden constraints identified.
