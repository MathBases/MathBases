Insertion-deletion correcting codes are designed to correct insertions and deletions of characters. Insertion-deletion distance measures the minimum number of insertions and/or deletions required to transform one word into another.  The database gives bounds on the number of optimal insertion-deletion codes with given length and insertion-deletion distance.
