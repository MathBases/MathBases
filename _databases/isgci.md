ISGCI is an encyclopaedia of graph classes with an accompanying java application that helps you to research what's known about particular graph classes. You can:

 * check the relation between graph classes and get a witness for the result
 * draw clear inclusion diagrams
 * colour these diagrams according to the complexity of selected problems
 * find the P/NP boundary for a problem
 * save your diagrams as Postscript, GraphML or SVG files
 * find references on classes, inclusions and algorithms
