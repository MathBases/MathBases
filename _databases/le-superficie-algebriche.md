  We include all minimal surfaces not of general type. In the case of surfaces of general type, there is a reasonable base collection, but there also still many entries missing.

This database visualizes the classification of minimal smooth compact complex algebraic surfaces.
For each entry we compute and display several invariants, such as Kodaira dimension, Chern numbers, irregularity, Betti numbers, the Hodge diamond, and more.
