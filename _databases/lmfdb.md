The LMFDB is a database of mathematical objects arising in number theory and arithmetic geometry that illustrates some of the mathematical connections predicted by the Langlands program.  It contains the following sections:

* L-functions
* Classical modular forms
* Maass forms
* Hilbert modular forms
* Bianchi modular forms
* Elliptic curves over Q
* Elliptic curves over number fields
* Genus 2 curves over Q
* Higher genus families of curves
* Abelian varieties over finite fields
* Number fields
* p-adic fields
* Dirichlet characters
* Artin representations
* Galois groups
* Sato-Tate groups

Some additional datasets are available on beta.lmfdb.org:

* Siegel modular forms
* Modular curves
* Belyi maps
* Hypergeometric motives over Q
* Abstract finite groups
* Lattices
