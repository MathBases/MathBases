short_description: data on the mod 2 Steenrod algebra
---

The dataset contains a minimal resolution of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra in the range 0 <= s <= 128, 0 <= t <= 200, together with chain maps for each cocycle in that range and for the squaring operation Sq^0 in the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra.
