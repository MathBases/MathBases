title: A Database for Number Fields

---

The database contains polynomials for all transitive groups up to degree 19, even for most of the possible combinations of signature and Galois group. Up to degree 7 the fields with minimal (absolute) discriminant with given Galois group and signature have been included. In degree 8 the minimal fields for all imprimitive groups and some of the primitive cases are also available.
