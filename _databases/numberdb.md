NumberDB is a collaborative database of numbers. The underlying idea is that in practise, numbers are determined by their first 10 digits. That makes them searchable. NumberDB attempts to be a tool to identify numbers, and to show known descriptions. Which numbers are stored depends on their simplicity and their relevance.
