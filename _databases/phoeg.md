title: PHOEG Helps to Obtain Extremal Graphs
short_description: A conjecture discovery system for extremal graphs

Plots pairs of graph invariants (chosen from 47 options) against each other, possibly with constraints on other invariants.  Invariants are computed and shown among graphs with a specified number of vertices.
