Supporting data for Regina, an open source package for low-dimensional topology.  In particular, it includes

* all prime knots with up to 19 crossings
* minimal triangulations of various 3-manifolds
* a triangluation of the Weber-Seifert dodecahedral space and its vertex normal surfaces, in support of the proof that it is non-Haken.
