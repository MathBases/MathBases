The SymbolicData project ended in 2018, but an archived version is still available.  Its goals were

 * to develop concepts and tools for profiling, testing and benchmarking Computer Algebra Software (CAS),
 * to collect and interlink relevant data and activities from different Computer Algebra Communities using modern Semantic Web concepts
 * and to contribute to the process of establishing a Global Digital Library of Mathematics.
