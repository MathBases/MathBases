A triangle cubic is a cubic curve in the plane defined by a reference triangle.  The database lists interesting such cubics, giving

 * an equation of the curve in barycentric coordinates
 * a list of triangle centers lying on the curve
 * other special points on the curve
 * geometric properties of the curve
 * diagrams and references
