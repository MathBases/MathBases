title: Unlabeled lattices on <=15 nodes

---

The unlabeled lattices on 15 or fewer nodes, up to isomorphism, are given in the following files as lists of cover relations. Each line of each file is the list of cover relations for a single lattice, and the cover relation [a,b] means b covers a. These files were generated with a Sage implementation of the algorithm of Heitzig and Reinhold.

In these files, the nodes of the lattices of order n are the integers from 0 to n-1. In each of these lattices 0 is the minimal element and 1 is the maximal element.
