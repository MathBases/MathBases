We welcome contributions!  When possible, please submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests) to our [Github repository](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases), but you are also welcome to [open an issue](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/issues) or [contact us](contact).  Any contributions will be released under the [CC BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

## Adding databases to the index

To add a new dataset to the index, you just need to create a new file in the [_databases folder](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/tree/main/_databases) following the [template for additions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MathBases/MathBases/main/template.md).  If you don't feel comfortable doing so, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/labels/database%20addition) with the "Database addition" label instead.  See our [policies](policies) for more information on what kinds of databases are in our scope.

## Helping others create databases

If you would like to add to MathBases' [resources](create) for creating new databases, we encourage you to submit an article or add a [template](/a/templates).  You are welcome to use the list of [stubs](stubs) for motivation, or submit something new.  Here is the process for submitting a new article.

1. Create a new file in the [_articles folder](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/tree/main/_articles) or edit one of the stubs.  Either way, add your name(s) in the author field at the top of the file.

2. Submit a pull request with your article on [Github](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases).  The [editorial board](board) will consider your submission and make a decision on whether to accept it (you are welcome to [reach out](contact) before writing to the article to get preliminary feedback).  We will aim to make decisions within two weeks at most.

3. If your article is accepted, the board and others will then suggest changes using Github's [review tools](https://github.com/features/code-review).  Once the article has been edited to everyone's satisfaction, it will be posted and become part of the site!

You are also welcome to suggest changes to an existing article; if your changes are substantial (adding or updating the content rather than fixing typos), you should also add yourself to the list of authors (chronologically by first contribution).

## Adding an idea

You may have an idea for a database but lack the time or mathematical expertise to make it happen.  If so, you can add to the list of [ideas](ideas) by adding a new file to the [_ideas folder](https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/tree/main/_ideas).

## Announcing a conference

If you know of a conference or workshop focused on mathematical databases, please let us know or add it to the list of [conferences](conferences) by making a pull request.

## Joining the community

If you are interested in mathematical databases, we encourage you to join us on [Zulip](https://code4math.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/416464-MathBases), where you can ask questions and share your own experience.
