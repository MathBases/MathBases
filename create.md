<h1 class="smallcaps">Implementing Mathematical DataBases</h1>

There will be resources here!

Here is an initial list of possible topics:

* How to bind a concrete dataset into Sage (https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/databases/index.html)
* [FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data) (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) guidelines for math (Katja's papers)
  - [Example of good practices for one data set](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-031-16681-5_22)
* Best practices for mathematical data sets (tie to badges)
* Accessibility like color blindness, etc
* How to use the DB templates
* How to use free MathHub hosting
    - update Katja's document
* Front ends/back ends (Zen and the art of database maintenance addresses this to some extent)
* How to secure hosting & funding (to get work done, to pay for servers) - NSF grants have credits that are currently underutilized
* Recruitment and community building
  - running workshops
  - related conferences
* License and copyright: options, how to choose, why it's important
* Reproducibility (recomputing the datasets) (cf. Rescience)
* Indepth technology papers pro/cons/how to use
  - postgres
  - sqlite
  - mongodb
  - flask and jinja
  - django for production
  - Github pages and Jekyll
  - Zenodo
  - Airtable
  - [Mathrepo](https://mathrepo.mis.mpg.de/) (see also [arXiv:2202.04022](https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2202.04022))
* Different kinds of datasets (benchmarking algorithms (set of evil examples), enumerations (all of something up to a certain size), zoo/encyclopedia, statements/theorems) and ways in which their needs differ.
