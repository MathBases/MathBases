<h1 class="smallcaps">Implementing Mathematical DataBases</h1>

We intend to add articles and documentation aimed at helping mathematicians create their own mathematical databases for inclusion in the index.  The list of desired articles is available on <a href="https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/labels/article%20request">github</a>, and we welcome article submissions along these lines, as well as additional ideas.

We also intend to create templates for getting a new project up and running quickly.  The list of desired templates is also available on <a href="https://github.com/MathBases/MathBases/labels/template%20request">github</a>.

In addition to these written resources, you can find other people interested in mathematical databases on the [MathBases Zulip chat server](https://code4math.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/416464-MathBases).  Attending a conference or workshop is also a good way to find people to talk to about your project.
