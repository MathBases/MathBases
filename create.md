<h1 class="smallcaps">Implementing Mathematical DataBases</h1>

If our [list](/) of databases has inspired you to create your own, you've come to the right place.  We've collected articles and documentation aimed at helping mathematicians create their own databases for inclusion in the index.  In addition to these written resources, you can find other people interested in mathematical databases on the [MathBases Zulip chat server](https://code4math.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/416464-MathBases).  Attending a [conference or workshop](conferences) is also a good way to find people to talk to about your project.

# Planning

1. Decide what kind of data you want to compute or collect: consult our list of [ideas](ideas), talk to other mathematicians, and think about what database you wish existed.

2. Decide how you want to [distribute](a/distribute) your data: as a webpage, within a computer algebra system, as an appendix to a paper, within an existing database, or as plain-text files.

3. Decide how you want to collaborate: is this a solo project or are you [building a team](a/team-building)?

4. Decide how you want to [host](a/hosting) your data and what [back-end](a/backend) and [front-end](a/frontend) tools best suit your needs.  We are working on creating [templates](a/templates) to make getting started even easier.

5. Pick [licenses](a/licenses) for your data and code, as well as a [name and URL](a/name-and-url) for your project.

# Getting Started

{:start="6"}
6. Create a [schema](a/schema), a detailed description of the quantities to be computed and how they relate to each other.

7. [Write code](a/math-coding) to compute the quantities specified in the schema.

8. Begin [creating the website or user interface](a/website-coding), using the interface to refine the schema and code.

9. Devise [consistency checks](a/math-testing) to ensure the reliability of your data and find bugs before running the computation at scale.

10. [Execute](a/computation-at-scale) the code at scale to create the underlying dataset.

# Searching and User interface

{:start="11"}
11. Create a [search interface](a/searching) that is appopriate for your dataset.

12. If making a website, refine your design using [CSS](a/css), [a logo](a/logo), [user logins](a/users), connections to the mathematical literature, and [interactive features](a/interactive).

13. Create [documentation and tutorials](a/documentation) for using your data.

# Maintenance

{:start="14"}
14. If your project continues to grow, it is very helpful to add [continuous integration testing](a/ci-testing) to catch interface errors.

15. If you are hosting a website, you may eventually need to implement strategies for [fighting bots](a/bot-fighting).

16. Make a plan for the [long term preservation](a/archiving) of your data so that it is still available after you have retired and are no longer paying for website hosting.

# Help others

{:start="17"}
17. Now that you are an expert on databases, [contribute an article here](contributing), [create a template](a/templates) or join the [MathBases Zulip chat server](https://code4math.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/416464-MathBases) and help others realize their data dreams!
