<h1 class="smallcaps">MathBases Policies</h1>

<h2>Use of this site</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Datasets added to this site must be publicly available.</li>
  <li>If a dataset becomes unavailailable, it should remain on the site but have "accessible" set to false.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scope of this site</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Datasets should be mathematical (if the topic lies between math and another field, that is acceptable).  As a rule of thumb, if the topic would be tagged with math.? on arxiv, it is okay.</li>
  <li>Datasets should consist of examples of mathematical objects, rather than exposition or formal statements (so appendixes in an arxiv paper tabulating examples are ok, but arXiv and Lean's mathlib are not)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Content</h2>
<ul>
  <li>When possible, metadata should either include all authors, or should point to an external location where all authors are listed.</li>
<ul>
